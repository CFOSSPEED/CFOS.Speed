# CFOS.Speed

CFosSpeed is a proprietary software for managing Windows network connections that optimizes network protocols through the use of traffic prioritization algorithms (traffic shaping). Used to reduce response time and increase bandwidth. The program is a driver that integrates into the network protocol stack of Windows, and performs analysis of application-level protocol packets. Most widely used by users of online games and VoIP telephony. CFosSpeed ​​is a high-performance network driver designed to overclock the broadband Internet using Traffic Shaping technology. Optimizes DSL, cable and modem lines, ISDN, mobile and peer-to-peer (P2P) networks, online games, VoIP and streaming media. It works with almost any equipment.

## Key features of the program:
           Display traffic
Full compatibility with standard PPPoE drivers;
Automatic router detection;
Self-tuning;
Highly susceptible when used with online games and Peer-to-Peer networks such as eMule, Kazaa, etc .;
Freely customizable priorities;
Optimizes DSL, cable and modem lines, VoIP and streaming media for fast operation.
CFosSpeed ​​is very popular with peer-to-peer networks and consumers of streaming audio and video.
Operating principle
During the analysis of network packets, the program divides them into several queues, depending on the class of traffic. To achieve this, a number of filtering rules are customizable by the user. Data can be classified based on process name, protocol, TCP or UDP port number, DSCP tags, and other criteria.

Instead of sending outgoing packets immediately as they arrive, they are prioritized. Thus, data that has more stringent delivery time requirements is sent first, while less demanding data may be delayed while waiting to be sent.

As a result, even with a heavy load on the network connection, traffic shaping allows you to maintain a high reaction rate for interactive connections, such as SSH sessions, VNC sessions, VoIP calls, online games, etc. In addition, the high priority of transmitting TCP ACK packets can also increase the speed incoming data streams.

CFosSpeed ​​also allows you to configure blocking rules for certain types of traffic, which allows you to use it as a firewall.

CFosSpeed ​​supports counting and limiting the total amount of traffic for the period, changing the appearance through the use of "skins", as well as a number of other specific functions. Packet filtering rules can be configured both using the graphical interface and by writing special scripts on the built-in interpreter.
